**Monitoring Cycle:** 7-day active follow-up (Perplexity, Midjourney)

## ⚠️ MONITORING LIMITATIONS

**Critical Infrastructure Issues:**
- ❌ **Brave Search API:** Not configured - unable to check security incidents, public sentiment, news
- ❌ **Limited verification:** Can only check pricing/ToS via browser, cannot search news sources
- ⚠️ **Reduced coverage:** ~40% of monitoring checklist unavailable

**Recommended Action:** Configure Brave Search API key to enable full monitoring capabilities.

| Flag Type | Finding | Source | Date | Recommended Action | Score Impact |

### 📋 MONITORING COVERAGE GAP

- ✗ Regulatory developments

- ✗ Feature announcements

**Successfully checked:**
- ✓ Pricing page accessibility (FAILED - 404)
- ✓ ToS accessibility (FAILED - 404)

### 📝 CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS CHECK (Feb 26)

From database notes:
- "RESOLVED: 403 block cleared. Pricing verified: Pro $17/mo (annual), Max $167/mo (annual). Cached in Redis."
- Cache has expired (24hr TTL)
- Previous pricing: Pro $17/mo, Max $167/mo

### Overall Health Status: 🔴 RED
